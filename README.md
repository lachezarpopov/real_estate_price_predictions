# Real Estate Price Predictions

This repository features a regression model trained to predict real estate property value for houses in Bangalore. This model is integrated into a prototype Flask application with a user interface. 

The [notebook & model folder](https://github.com/lachezarpopov/real_estate_price_predictions/tree/main/notebook%20%26%20model) contains a jupyter notebook featuring the data exploration, preparation, training & evaluation of the real estate pricing model.

The [app folder](https://github.com/lachezarpopov/real_estate_price_predictions/tree/main/app) features a Flask application for interaction with the model through a UI. The [client subfolder](https://github.com/lachezarpopov/real_estate_price_predictions/tree/main/app/client) contains the front-end files (HTML, CSS & Javascript) and the [server subfolder](https://github.com/lachezarpopov/real_estate_price_predictions/tree/main/app/server) contains the Flask server files.
